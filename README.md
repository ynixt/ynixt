### Welcome ðŸ‘‹


I'm a **developer with dreams** and one of the founders of **[UnkApps](https://github.com/unkapps)**, an incubator for personal projects, like [Uai MangÃ¡s](https://github.com/unkapps/uai-mangas). You can see another projects on our [website](https://unkapps.com).


Right now I'm working in two projects:
 - [Shared Finances](https://github.com/ynixt/shared-finances): A site for controlling individual or shared finances. It uses Angular and NestJS;
 - A game in Unity that I plan to market on Steam.
